### Hi, I'm Toqa ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ethical hacking and cybersecurity undergraduate eager to contribute to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent technical skills. Below you'll find various repositories that are mainly university projects. These projects include pen-testing, digital forensics, network security, operating systems, etc.
