### Hi, I'm Toqa ðŸ‘‹

An enthusiastic Ethical Hacker and Cyber Security graduate with First Class Honors from Coventry University. As a dedicated and detail-orientated Cyber Security Consultant, I continuously seek to analyze vulnerabilities, implement resilient security measures, and uphold compliance with industry standards. Below you'll find various repositories that are mainly university projects. These projects include pen-testing, digital forensics, network security, operating systems, etc.
